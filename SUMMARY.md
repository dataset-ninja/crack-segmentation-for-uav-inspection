**Crack Segmentation for UAV Inspection** is a dataset for instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the industrial industry.

The dataset consists of 11298 images with 9844 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*crack*).

Each image in the Crack Segmentation for UAV Inspection dataset has pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 1454 (13% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *ds0* (11298 images). The dataset was released in 2019.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
